Fake News Detection:
I have used machine learning to develop this project. Supervised algorithms like Linear regression and SVM were used to train model.
Out of which SVM Detected fake news with an accuracy of almost  92%.  
First  preprocess the dataset so data processing was carried out. For which tokenization, lemmatization and stop word removal were used.
Further the feature extraction was carried out on the pre-processed data then the data is provided to the respective classifier for training
purpose which further provides with the fake and truthful opinion. Technologies used-Python, Machine learning, Jupyter Notebook
